In this folder i present my first neural nets on python.
I created my own dataset of handwritten letters A and C and wrote a nn for its recognition.

File AC_npy.ipynb is my implementation on pure numpy without using any machine learning libraries.
File AC_torch.ipynb is an equivalent realisation but using pytorch.
